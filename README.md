NL is a triangle strips oriented model format, that does not require face data to build model geometry.

This format were developed by AM2 division, extensively used by SEGA between 1999-2001 in SEGA Naomi arcade hardware and SEGA Dreamcast.
Currently there are two known NaomiLib versions: `NLOBJPUT Ver.0.99` and `0.8`, which were probably referencing the 3D software plugin used to export them.
